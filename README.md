The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. This program takes as arguments a set of int values and use 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

This program calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.

## Usage
```
gcl https://github.com/robinbnc/push_swap.git
cd Push_swap
make
./push_swap [list of unsorted numbers]
```
Output : the shortest push_swap language algorithm that sorts the list.
